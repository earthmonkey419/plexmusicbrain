# Plex Music Brain

An AI-powered music companion for Plex. Generates playlists from natural language prompts, enriches your library with specific genre tags, analyzes your listening history, and surfaces gaps in your collection.

Built for a Synology NAS running Plex. Self-hosted, self-contained, no subscriptions.

---

## Features

- AI genre enrichment — 15,000+ tracks tagged with specific subgenres (shoegaze, dance-punk, balearic, etc) and written back to Plex
- Last.fm integration — 111K+ scrobbles driving real play counts and listening patterns
- Listening context playlists — Your Afternoon, Weekend Flow, Often Together (based on actual behavior)
- Metadata filters — gender, country, era, genre, year, play count, rating
- Compilation enrichment — real artist names recovered from ID3 tags for Various Artists tracks
- Library gap analysis — artists you scrobble heavily but don't own, categorized and prioritized
- Admin panel — one-click sync pipeline with live streaming output

## Web UI Guide

URL: http://YOUR_NAS_IP:8787 or https://YOUR_TUNNEL_DOMAIN

### Playlist Generator (/)

Prompt (optional):
  Natural language mood/vibe. Examples:
    "late night psychedelic soul"
    "sunny day driving with the windows down"
    "garagy grungy rock"
    "quiet and watery"
  OpenAI expands prompt into 10-15 specific tags, matched against track_tags.

Filters:
  Unplayed only    play_count = 0
  Genre            AI tag dropdown (100 most common tags)
  From/To year     album release year range
  Limit            max tracks returned (default 30)
  Max per artist   prevents one artist dominating (default 3)
  Min rating       Plex star rating (4 stars = user_rating >= 8)
  Gender           female / male / mixed
  Country          US / UK / BR / FR / JP / AU / IE / CA / SE / DE
  Era              50s through 20s

Flow:
  1. Type prompt and/or set filters
  2. Click Preview (or press Enter)
  3. Review scored track list
  4. Edit playlist name if desired
  5. Click Create in Plex

### Library Gaps (/gaps)
  Artists with 50+ Last.fm scrobbles not in your Plex library.
  Four collapsible buckets: Worth Acquiring, Classical, Ambient/Meditation, Unknown.

### Admin Panel (/admin)
  Full Sync               Complete pipeline: scan -> ingest -> Last.fm -> tag
  Scan Plex Library       Triggers Plex to scan for new files on disk
  Sync Plex Library       Ingests tracks into SQLite (incremental)
  Sync Last.fm            Pulls new scrobbles since last sync
  Tag New Tracks          AI tags any untagged tracks
  Refresh Context         Rebuilds Your Afternoon, Weekend Flow, Often Together
  Refresh Gap Analysis    Re-runs gap analysis, removes acquired artists

  Note: Use direct IP for long-running jobs — Cloudflare times out SSE after ~100s.

### DB Query Console (/db)
  Run any SELECT query. Click hints to load examples. Ctrl+Enter to run.

Useful queries (also available as hints in DB Console):
  Top played:
    SELECT artist, title, play_count FROM tracks
    ORDER BY play_count DESC LIMIT 20

  Genre breakdown:
    SELECT tag, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM track_tags
    GROUP BY tag ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 30

  Female artists:
    SELECT DISTINCT COALESCE(real_artist, artist) as artist FROM tracks t
    JOIN artist_meta m ON m.artist = COALESCE(t.real_artist, t.artist)
    WHERE m.gender = "female" ORDER BY artist

  Listening by year:
    SELECT strftime("%Y", datetime(timestamp, "unixepoch", "localtime")) as year,
    COUNT(*) as plays FROM lastfm_scrobbles GROUP BY year ORDER BY year

  Gap artists worth acquiring:
    SELECT artist, scrobbles FROM artist_gaps
    WHERE category = "worth_acquiring" ORDER BY scrobbles DESC

## Known Issues and Workarounds

Cloudflare SSE timeout
  Long-running admin jobs time out through Cloudflare after ~100 seconds.
  Workaround: use direct IP http://YOUR_NAS_IP:8787/admin for long jobs.

Plex duplicate tracks
  Same track may appear with different rating_keys due to multiple library folders.
  Handled by GROUP BY artist, title in queries.

Various Artists metadata
  Plex rolls compilation tracks up as "Various Artists".
  Fixed by enrich_compilations.py which reads real artist from TPE1 ID3 tag.
  Queries use COALESCE(real_artist, artist) as effective artist.

Last.fm name mismatches
  Artist names differ between Last.fm and Plex (e.g. "Netta" vs "Netta Barzilai").
  Gap cleanup uses fuzzy matching (substring) to handle this.

Broad Plex genres
  Plex uses ~14 broad genre buckets. AI tags in track_tags are the richer source.
  Genre dropdown in UI uses AI tags, not Plex genres.

Ratings sparse
  Only a handful of tracks rated in Plex. Play count from Last.fm is more useful.

## Roadmap

- Public release + GitHub
- Summer/seasonal listening playlists
- MusicBrainz integration for higher accuracy metadata
- Ollama for local AI tagging (reduce OpenAI costs)
- Polling approach for admin jobs (fix Cloudflare SSE timeout properly)
- Rediscovery playlist — heavily played tracks not heard in 2+ years
- Mobile-optimized UI
